# AI Project Context

## Summary

This website hosts information about Uranium Glass, and serves as a locally hosted
marketplace with a complete inventory system that updates components used in crafting
sales items, and serves as the source of truth via API for Etsy and eBay.

Current stage: early. The live site is a "Coming Soon" landing page. The shop/inventory/
orders UI is scaffolded but not yet routed, and most backend content routes are not yet
mounted. PostgreSQL is planned but not present.

## Existing Documentation

Prefer these as the source of truth; do not duplicate them here.

- `README.md` — one-paragraph overview + getting started.
- `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md` — active objective, current state, next steps.
- `structure.txt` — annotated source tree.
- `CLAUDE.md` — working rules and common commands.

## Layout & Entry Points

- Root `package.json`: `npm run dev` runs frontend + backend together via `concurrently`.
- Frontend (`frontend/`): Vite dev server. Entry `src/main.jsx` -> `src/App.jsx`.
  React 18, react-router-dom 7, `@` alias -> `src`.
- Backend (`backend/`): Express, ESM. Entry `server/server.js`. Listens on port 3000
  (`process.env.PORT || 3000`).

## Major Components

| Component | Responsibility | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Web UI | React storefront: landing, shop, orders. Only `/`, `/about`, `/shop`, `/test` are routed today. | `frontend/src/` (`App.jsx`, `pages/`, `components/shop/`) |
| Landing page | Currently-shipping "Coming Soon" page + assets | `frontend/src/pages/ComingSoon.jsx`, `styles/ComingSoon.css`, `assets/coming-soon/` |
| OAuth / marketplace API | Etsy + eBay OAuth flows and token validation | `backend/server/server.js` |
| Content routes | `/api/*` content endpoints, aggregated by `index.js` and mounted at `/api` | `backend/server/routes/` (`index.js` + siblings) |
| Token storage | File-based persistence of Etsy/eBay access tokens | `backend/server/utils/*TokenStorage.js` |

## API Endpoints (backend, port 3000)

Defined directly in `server.js`:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Server status + route index |
| GET | `/auth/etsy` | Start Etsy OAuth |
| GET | `/oauth/etsy-callback` | Etsy OAuth callback (token exchange) |
| GET | `/api/etsy/validate-token` | Validate stored Etsy token |
| GET | `/auth/ebay` | Start eBay OAuth |
| GET | `/oauth/ebay-callback` | eBay OAuth callback (token exchange) |
| GET | `/api/ebay/validate-token` | Validate stored eBay token |
| GET | `/api/ebay/dummy-listing` | eBay item search w/ fallback (`ebayDummyListing.js`) |

Content routes, aggregated by `routes/index.js` and mounted at `/api`:

| Method | Path | Source |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/listings` | `routes/listings.js` |
| GET | `/api/sales` | `routes/sales.js` |
| GET | `/api/about` | `routes/about.js` |
| GET | `/api/faqs` | `routes/faqs.js` |
| GET | `/api/mock/etsy/mock-listing` | `routes/mockListing.js` |

Each content router uses `/` internally; the path segment (`/listings`, `/sales`, …)
comes from the mount in `index.js`. Any other path returns `404 { error: 'Route not found.' }`.

## External Systems

| System | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Etsy API | OAuth (`/auth/etsy`, `/oauth/etsy-callback`), token validate; product/listing source of truth |
| eBay API | OAuth (`/auth/ebay`, `/oauth/ebay-callback`), token validate; sandbox/production via `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT`; dummy listing endpoint |

## Important Constraints

- Don't break existing APIs.
- Do not commit secrets. Etsy/eBay credentials live in `backend/.env` (gitignored).
- Do not commit generated Repomix context files.

## Sources of Truth

- Business behavior: `backend/server/server.js` + `backend/server/routes/`.
- Marketplace data: Etsy and eBay APIs (this app brokers OAuth + acts as intended source of truth).
- Database schema: none yet (PostgreSQL planned).
- API contracts: `backend/server/routes/` (per-router files).
- Deployment configuration: frontend targets Vercel (see commit history); not documented here.

## Known Traps

- Each content router in `routes/` uses `/` internally and gets its path segment from the
  mount in `index.js`. When adding a new content route, add it to `index.js` (don't repeat
  the segment inside the router file, or you'll get a doubled path like `/api/x/x`).
- `server.js` calls `open()` on all auth/validate URLs at boot — starting the backend will
  try to launch browser tabs.
- Scaffolded `pages/Shop/*` and `pages/Orders/*` exist but are not referenced by the router.
